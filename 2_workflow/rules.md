# Workflow Rules and Principles

This document contains the core principles and strategic guidelines that govern the content generation workflow.

## 1. Core Principles

1.  **Visual-First:** The image or video is the hero. The caption serves to add context, personality, and a call to action. The visual must be compelling on its own.
2.  **Conversation is King:** The primary goal is not just to post, but to spark conversation. Every caption should be crafted to elicit a response (replies, quotes, questions), which is heavily rewarded by the X algorithm.
3.  **Authenticity Over Automation:** The tone should be that of a passionate, knowledgeable community member, not a corporate broadcaster. Embrace humor, player-centric language, and genuine enthusiasm.
4.  **Global-Local Mindset:** While adhering to a global brand voice, captions will be adapted to the cultural nuances of target markets (e.g., English, Japanese, Korean), especially regarding tone, humor, and engagement tactics.
5.  **Accessibility First:** All visual media requires descriptive alt text. This is non-negotiable for inclusivity and SEO. **No Unicode-based text styling (e.g., bold, italics)** will be used to ensure readability for screen readers.

## 2. Strategic Hashtag Strategy

Follow a structured hashtag strategy to maximize reach and relevance.

*   **Limit:** Use up to 5 hashtags per tweet.
*   **Structure:**
    *   **Default Hashtags (Required):** The first four hashtags are always the same to ensure consistent brand and game identification.
        1.  `#AFKJourney`
        2.  `#AFKJ`
        3.  `#AFKJourneyGuide`
        4.  `#AFKジャーニー`
    *   **Targeted Contextual Tag (Required):** The fifth and final hashtag is a precision tool for targeting niche conversations. Its selection is prioritized as follows:
        *   **Primary:** A specific game mode, boss, or event identified in the image (e.g., `#PrimalLord`, `#BattleDrill`, `#DreamRealm`).
        *   **Secondary:** If no specific mode applies, use a broader, relevant tag like `#GameStrategy` or `#GachaGaming`.
        *   **Exclusion:** This tag should **not** be a creator, author, or influencer name.
